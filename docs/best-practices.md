# Best Practices

This guide outlines recommended best practices for using Flowlyt effectively in your development workflow, from individual developers to enterprise-scale implementations.

## Development Workflow Integration

### 1. Early Integration

**Start Security Left:** Integrate Flowlyt early in your development process.

```bash
# Pre-commit hook integration
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
echo "üîç Running security scan before commit..."

# Run Flowlyt on changed workflow files
changed_workflows=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\.github/workflows/.*\.ya?ml$|\.gitlab-ci\.ya?ml$')

if [ -n "$changed_workflows" ]; then
    echo "Checking workflow files: $changed_workflows"
    
    # Create temporary directory for analysis
    temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)
    
    # Copy changed files to temp directory
    for file in $changed_workflows; do
        mkdir -p "$temp_dir/$(dirname "$file")"
        git show ":$file" > "$temp_dir/$file"
    done
    
    # Run security scan
    if ! flowlyt --repo "$temp_dir" --min-severity HIGH --quiet; then
        echo "‚ùå Security issues found in workflow files!"
        echo "Please fix the issues before committing."
        rm -rf "$temp_dir"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    rm -rf "$temp_dir"
    echo "‚úÖ Security scan passed"
fi
```

**IDE Integration:** Configure your IDE for real-time feedback.

```json
// VS Code settings.json
{
    "files.associations": {
        "*.yml": "yaml",
        "*.yaml": "yaml"
    },
    "yaml.schemas": {
        "https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow.json": ".github/workflows/*.yml"
    },
    "task.enableTasks": "on",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Security Scan",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "flowlyt",
            "args": ["--repo", ".", "--output", "cli"],
            "group": "build",
            "presentation": {
                "echo": true,
                "reveal": "always",
                "focus": false,
                "panel": "shared"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Configuration Management

**Hierarchical Configuration:** Use layered configuration for flexibility.

```yaml
# Global organization config: .flowlyt-org.yml
organization:
  name: "Acme Corporation"
  security_policy_version: "2.0"

rules:
  # Mandatory organization rules
  mandatory:
    - "HARDCODED_SECRET"
    - "DANGEROUS_COMMAND"
    - "BROAD_PERMISSIONS"
  
  # Recommended rules
  recommended:
    - "INSECURE_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET"
    - "SUPPLY_CHAIN_ATTACK"

compliance:
  required_frameworks: ["SOC2"]
  
enforcement:
  critical_issues: "block"
  high_issues: "warn"
```

```yaml
# Team-specific config: .flowlyt-team.yml
team:
  name: "Backend Engineering"
  extends: ".flowlyt-org.yml"

# Team-specific customizations
custom_rules:
  - id: "BACKEND_SPECIFIC_SECRETS"
    patterns:
      - "DATABASE_PASSWORD_[A-Za-z0-9]+"
      - "REDIS_AUTH_TOKEN_[A-Fa-f0-9]+"

ignore:
  files:
    - "test/**/*"
    - "scripts/dev-only/*"
```

```yaml
# Repository config: .flowlyt.yml  
repository:
  name: "payment-service"
  extends: ".flowlyt-team.yml"

# Repository-specific overrides
rules:
  additional:
    - "PCI_COMPLIANCE_REQUIRED"    # Financial service specific
    
ignore:
  # Project-specific ignores
  files:
    - "migrations/**/*"            # Database migrations
    - "docs/examples/**/*"         # Documentation examples
```

### 3. Incremental Adoption

**Gradual Rule Introduction:** Introduce rules progressively to avoid overwhelming teams.

```yaml
# Phase 1: Critical security only (Month 1)
phase_1:
  rules:
    enabled:
      - "HARDCODED_SECRET"
  enforcement: "advisory"
  training:
    - "Secret management workshop"

# Phase 2: Add dangerous patterns (Month 2)
phase_2:
  rules:
    enabled:
      - "HARDCODED_SECRET"
      - "DANGEROUS_COMMAND"
  enforcement: "permissive"
  training:
    - "Secure shell scripting"

# Phase 3: Full security baseline (Month 3+)
phase_3:
  rules:
    enabled:
      - "HARDCODED_SECRET"
      - "DANGEROUS_COMMAND"
      - "BROAD_PERMISSIONS"
      - "INSECURE_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET"
  enforcement: "strict"
```

## Rule Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Rule Selection Strategy

**Risk-Based Prioritization:** Focus on rules that address your highest risks.

```yaml
# Risk assessment mapping
risk_matrix:
  critical_business_impact:
    rules:
      - "HARDCODED_SECRET"       # Data breach risk
      - "SUPPLY_CHAIN_ATTACK"    # Third-party risk
      - "MALICIOUS_BASE64_DECODE" # Code injection risk
    
  operational_impact:
    rules:
      - "DANGEROUS_COMMAND"      # System stability
      - "BROAD_PERMISSIONS"      # Access control
      
  compliance_impact:
    rules:
      - "AUDIT_TRAIL_REQUIRED"   # Regulatory compliance
      - "ENCRYPTION_MANDATED"    # Data protection
```

**Environment-Specific Rules:** Tailor rules to environment criticality.

```yaml
# Development environment - learning focused
development:
  rules:
    enabled:
      - "HARDCODED_SECRET"
      - "DANGEROUS_COMMAND"
  enforcement: "advisory"
  education_mode: true

# Staging environment - validation focused  
staging:
  rules:
    enabled:
      - "HARDCODED_SECRET"
      - "DANGEROUS_COMMAND"
      - "BROAD_PERMISSIONS"
  enforcement: "permissive"
  
# Production environment - strict security
production:
  rules:
    enabled:
      - "HARDCODED_SECRET"
      - "DANGEROUS_COMMAND"
      - "BROAD_PERMISSIONS"
      - "INSECURE_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET"
      - "SUPPLY_CHAIN_ATTACK"
      - "MALICIOUS_BASE64_DECODE"
  enforcement: "strict"
  zero_tolerance: ["CRITICAL"]
```

### 2. Custom Rule Development

**Organization-Specific Patterns:** Develop rules for your specific technology stack.

```yaml
# Technology stack specific rules
custom_rules:
  # Cloud provider specific
  - id: "AWS_SPECIFIC_SECRETS"
    name: "AWS Credential Detection"
    patterns:
      - "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}"              # AWS Access Key ID
      - "aws_secret_access_key.*[A-Za-z0-9/+]{40}"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    
  # Database specific  
  - id: "DATABASE_CREDENTIALS"
    name: "Database Credential Detection"
    patterns:
      - "mongodb://[^\\s]+:[^\\s]+@"
      - "mysql://[^\\s]+:[^\\s]+@"
      - "postgresql://[^\\s]+:[^\\s]+@"
    severity: "HIGH"
    
  # Internal service specific
  - id: "INTERNAL_API_KEYS"
    name: "Internal API Key Detection"
    patterns:
      - "COMPANY_API_[A-Z_]+_[A-Za-z0-9]{32}"
      - "INTERNAL_SERVICE_[A-Z_]+_KEY"
    severity: "HIGH"
```

**Business Logic Rules:** Create rules for business-specific security requirements.

```yaml
# Business-specific security rules
custom_rules:
  # Financial services
  - id: "FINANCIAL_DATA_HANDLING"
    name: "Financial Data Handling Rules"
    description: "Ensures proper handling of financial data"
    patterns:
      - "account_number.*[0-9]{10,}"
      - "routing_number.*[0-9]{9}"
      - "credit_card.*[0-9]{4}[\\s-][0-9]{4}[\\s-][0-9]{4}[\\s-][0-9]{4}"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    compliance: ["PCI-DSS"]
    
  # Healthcare
  - id: "PHI_PROTECTION"
    name: "Protected Health Information"
    description: "Detects potential PHI in workflows"
    patterns:
      - "ssn.*[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}"
      - "patient_id.*[A-Z0-9]{8,}"
      - "medical_record.*[0-9]{6,}"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    compliance: ["HIPAA"]
```

### 3. Exception Management

**Systematic Exception Handling:** Manage exceptions through clear processes.

```yaml
# Exception management framework
exception_management:
  approval_process:
    low_severity:
      approvers: ["team_lead"]
      duration: "30 days"
      
    medium_severity:
      approvers: ["team_lead", "security_champion"]
      duration: "15 days"
      justification_required: true
      
    high_severity:
      approvers: ["security_team", "team_lead"]
      duration: "7 days"
      business_justification_required: true
      
    critical_severity:
      approvers: ["ciso", "security_team", "team_lead"]
      duration: "3 days"
      executive_approval_required: true

  tracking:
    exception_database: "security_exceptions.db"
    review_frequency: "weekly"
    expiration_alerts: true
    
  governance:
    regular_review: "monthly"
    trend_analysis: "quarterly"
    policy_updates: "as_needed"
```

## CI/CD Integration Best Practices

### 1. Pipeline Integration

**Multi-Stage Security:** Implement security checks at multiple pipeline stages.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-pipeline.yml
name: Security Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  # Stage 1: Early security scan
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Install Flowlyt
        run: go install github.com/harekrishnarai/flowlyt/cmd/flowlyt@latest
        
      - name: Security Analysis
        run: |
          flowlyt --repo . \
                  --output json \
                  --output-file security-report.json \
                  --min-severity MEDIUM
                  
      - name: Upload Security Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: security-report
          path: security-report.json

  # Stage 2: Comprehensive security (on main branch)
  comprehensive-security:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: security-scan
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Install Flowlyt
        run: go install github.com/harekrishnarai/flowlyt/cmd/flowlyt@latest
        
      - name: Comprehensive Security Scan
        run: |
          flowlyt --repo . \
                  --config .flowlyt-production.yml \
                  --output json \
                  --output-file comprehensive-report.json
                  
      - name: Security Gate
        run: |
          CRITICAL=$(jq '.summary.critical' comprehensive-report.json)
          if [ "$CRITICAL" -gt 0 ]; then
            echo "‚ùå Critical security issues found!"
            exit 1
          fi

  # Stage 3: Compliance check (scheduled)
  compliance-check:
    if: github.event_name == 'schedule'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Install Flowlyt
        run: go install github.com/harekrishnarai/flowlyt/cmd/flowlyt@latest
        
      - name: SOC 2 Compliance Check
        run: |
          flowlyt --repo . \
                  --config .flowlyt-soc2.yml \
                  --compliance-report \
                  --output-file soc2-compliance.json
```

### 2. Feedback Loops

**Developer-Friendly Feedback:** Provide actionable feedback to developers.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/security-feedback.sh

# Generate developer-friendly security report
generate_dev_report() {
    local findings_file="$1"
    local output_file="$2"
    
    cat > "$output_file" << EOF
# üîç Security Analysis Results

## Summary
$(jq -r '"- Critical: " + (.summary.critical | tostring) + "\n- High: " + (.summary.high | tostring) + "\n- Medium: " + (.summary.medium | tostring) + "\n- Low: " + (.summary.low | tostring)' "$findings_file")

## Actions Required

$(jq -r '.findings[] | select(.severity == "CRITICAL") | "### ‚ùå CRITICAL: " + .rule_name + "\n**File:** " + .file_path + ":" + (.line_number | tostring) + "\n**Issue:** " + .description + "\n**Fix:** " + .remediation + "\n"' "$findings_file")

$(jq -r '.findings[] | select(.severity == "HIGH") | "### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: " + .rule_name + "\n**File:** " + .file_path + ":" + (.line_number | tostring) + "\n**Issue:** " + .description + "\n**Fix:** " + .remediation + "\n"' "$findings_file")

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# scripts/security-metrics.py

import json
import datetime
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_security_metrics(reports_dir):
    """Calculate security metrics from Flowlyt reports"""
    
    metrics = {
        'trend_analysis': defaultdict(list),
        'team_performance': defaultdict(dict),
        'rule_effectiveness': defaultdict(int),
        'resolution_time': defaultdict(list)
    }
    
    # Process all security reports
    for report_file in glob.glob(f"{reports_dir}/*.json"):
        with open(report_file) as f:
            report = json.load(f)
            
        date = extract_date_from_filename(report_file)
        team = report.get('metadata', {}).get('team', 'unknown')
        
        # Trend analysis
        metrics['trend_analysis'][date].append({
            'critical': report['summary']['critical'],
            'high': report['summary']['high'],
            'total': report['summary']['total']
        })
        
        # Rule effectiveness
        for finding in report.get('findings', []):
            rule_id = finding['rule_id']
            metrics['rule_effectiveness'][rule_id] += 1
            
        # Team performance
        if team not in metrics['team_performance']:
            metrics['team_performance'][team] = {
                'total_issues': 0,
                'critical_issues': 0,
                'resolution_rate': 0
            }
            
        metrics['team_performance'][team]['total_issues'] += report['summary']['total']
        metrics['team_performance'][team]['critical_issues'] += report['summary']['critical']
    
    return metrics

def generate_executive_dashboard(metrics):
    """Generate executive dashboard from metrics"""
    
    dashboard = {
        'security_posture': {
            'overall_score': calculate_security_score(metrics),
            'trend': calculate_trend(metrics),
            'critical_issues': sum_critical_issues(metrics)
        },
        'team_rankings': rank_teams_by_performance(metrics),
        'top_vulnerabilities': get_top_vulnerabilities(metrics),
        'recommendations': generate_recommendations(metrics)
    }
    
    return dashboard

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    metrics = calculate_security_metrics("security-reports/")
    dashboard = generate_executive_dashboard(metrics)
    
    with open("security-dashboard.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(dashboard, f, indent=2)
        
    print("Security dashboard generated: security-dashboard.json")
```

- **Developer Surveys**: Monthly satisfaction surveys
- **Tool Usage Analytics**: Adoption and effectiveness metrics
- **Success Stories**: Share wins and improvements
```

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Feedback Collection

**Systematic Feedback:** Collect and act on user feedback.

```python
# Feedback collection system
feedback_system = {
    'collection_methods': [
        'In-tool feedback forms',
        'Developer surveys',
        'Security champion feedback',
        'Usage analytics',
        'Support ticket analysis'
    ],
    
    'feedback_categories': [
        'Tool usability',
        'Rule accuracy',
        'Performance issues',
        'Feature requests',
        'Training needs'
    ],
    
    'response_process': {
        'triage': 'Weekly feedback review',
        'prioritization': 'Impact vs effort matrix',
        'implementation': 'Sprint planning integration',
        'communication': 'Regular update broadcasts'
    }
}
```

### 2. Rule Evolution

**Adaptive Security:** Continuously improve rules based on experience.

```yaml
# Rule evolution process
rule_evolution:
  monitoring:
    false_positive_tracking: true
    true_positive_validation: true
    performance_metrics: true
    
  analysis:
    monthly_review:
      - "False positive rate by rule"
      - "Detection effectiveness"
      - "Performance impact"
      
    quarterly_assessment:
      - "New threat patterns"
      - "Industry best practices"
      - "Technology stack changes"
      
  improvement:
    rule_tuning:
      frequency: "continuous"
      criteria: "FP rate > 10%"
      
    new_rule_development:
      frequency: "monthly"
      sources: ["Threat intelligence", "Incident analysis"]
      
    rule_retirement:
      frequency: "quarterly"
      criteria: "No detections in 6 months"
```

### 3. Success Measurement

**Outcome-Based Metrics:** Measure security outcomes, not just activity.

```yaml
# Success metrics framework
success_metrics:
  security_outcomes:
    - metric: "Security incident reduction"
      target: "50% reduction YoY"
      measurement: "Incident count and severity"
      
    - metric: "Vulnerability detection time"
      target: "< 24 hours from introduction"
      measurement: "Time from commit to detection"
      
    - metric: "Mean time to resolution"
      target: "< 72 hours for critical issues"
      measurement: "Detection to fix deployment"
      
  process_efficiency:
    - metric: "Policy compliance rate"
      target: "95% organization-wide"
      measurement: "Compliant repositories/total repositories"
      
    - metric: "Developer satisfaction"
      target: "4.0/5.0 average rating"
      measurement: "Quarterly developer surveys"
      
    - metric: "False positive rate"
      target: "< 10% per rule"
      measurement: "FP reports/total findings"
      
  business_impact:
    - metric: "Security review cycle time"
      target: "50% reduction from baseline"
      measurement: "Time from code to production"
      
    - metric: "Compliance audit preparation"
      target: "90% automation of evidence collection"
      measurement: "Manual vs automated evidence"
      
    - metric: "Security training effectiveness"
      target: "80% knowledge retention"
      measurement: "Post-training assessments"
```
