# Policy Enforcement

Flowlyt provides comprehensive policy enforcement capabilities to ensure CI/CD workflows comply with organizational security standards, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices.

## Overview

Policy enforcement in Flowlyt goes beyond simple rule checking. It implements a sophisticated policy framework that allows organizations to:

- Define organizational security policies as code
- Enforce compliance across all CI/CD workflows
- Generate compliance reports for auditing
- Implement graduated enforcement (warn, fail, block)
- Support regulatory frameworks (SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

## Policy Framework Architecture

### Policy Levels

Flowlyt implements a hierarchical policy system:

1. **Organization Policies** - Global policies for all repositories
2. **Team Policies** - Policies specific to teams or departments
3. **Repository Policies** - Repository-specific policies
4. **Workflow Policies** - Individual workflow overrides

### Policy Types

#### Security Policies
Focus on security best practices and vulnerability prevention:
- Secret management
- Access control
- Dangerous command prevention
- Dependency security

#### Compliance Policies
Ensure adherence to regulatory and industry standards:
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- PCI DSS compliance
- HIPAA security rules
- ISO 27001 controls

#### Operational Policies
Maintain operational excellence and reliability:
- Build standards
- Deployment practices
- Monitoring requirements
- Documentation standards

## Policy Enforcement Mechanisms

### Enforcement Modes

#### Advisory Mode
Policies generate warnings but don't block execution:

```yaml
enforcement:
  mode: "advisory"
  actions:
    - type: "log_warning"
      message: "Policy violation detected: {rule_name}"
    - type: "create_issue"
      title: "Policy Compliance Issue"
      labels: ["policy-violation", "security"]
```

#### Permissive Mode
Policies can fail builds but allow overrides:

```yaml
enforcement:
  mode: "permissive"
  allow_overrides: true
  override_requirements:
    - approval_from: ["security-team", "compliance-officer"]
    - justification_required: true
    - time_limited: "30 days"
  actions:
    - type: "fail_build"
      condition: "severity >= HIGH"
    - type: "require_approval"
      condition: "severity == CRITICAL"
```

#### Strict Mode
Policies strictly enforce compliance:

```yaml
enforcement:
  mode: "strict"
  allow_overrides: false
  actions:
    - type: "block_deployment"
      condition: "severity >= MEDIUM"
    - type: "quarantine_repository"
      condition: "critical_violations > 0"
    - type: "notify_security_team"
      immediate: true
```

### Graduated Enforcement

Implement progressive policy enforcement:

```yaml
# .flowlyt-enforcement.yml
graduated_enforcement:
  phases:
    # Phase 1: Education and Awareness
    - name: "education"
      duration: "30 days"
      enforcement_mode: "advisory"
      actions:
        - "log_violations"
        - "send_educational_materials"
        - "schedule_training_sessions"
        
    # Phase 2: Soft Enforcement
    - name: "soft_enforcement"
      duration: "60 days"
      enforcement_mode: "permissive"
      actions:
        - "warn_on_violations"
        - "require_acknowledgment"
        - "track_compliance_metrics"
        
    # Phase 3: Full Enforcement
    - name: "full_enforcement"
      enforcement_mode: "strict"
      actions:
        - "block_on_violations"
        - "require_remediation"
        - "escalate_persistent_violations"
```

## Policy as Code

### Version Control Integration

Store and manage policies as code:

```bash
# Repository structure for policy management
policies/
├── organizational/
│   ├── security-baseline.yml
│   ├── compliance-frameworks/
│   │   ├── soc2.yml
│   │   ├── pci-dss.yml
│   │   └── hipaa.yml
│   └── operational-standards.yml
├── team-specific/
│   ├── engineering.yml
│   ├── devops.yml
│   └── security.yml
└── repository-overrides/
    ├── critical-systems.yml
    └── public-projects.yml
```

### Policy Testing

Test policies before deployment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/policy-testing.yml
name: Policy Testing
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['policies/**']

jobs:
  test-policies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Validate policy syntax
        run: |
          flowlyt validate-policies --path policies/
          
      - name: Test policy against sample workflows
        run: |
          # Test against known good workflows
          flowlyt test-policy \
            --policy policies/organizational/security-baseline.yml \
            --workflow test/fixtures/good-workflow.yml \
            --expect pass
            
          # Test against known bad workflows  
          flowlyt test-policy \
            --policy policies/organizational/security-baseline.yml \
            --workflow test/fixtures/bad-workflow.yml \
            --expect fail
            
      - name: Policy impact analysis
        run: |
          flowlyt policy-impact \
            --policy policies/organizational/security-baseline.yml \
            --scope organization \
            --output policy-impact-report.md
```

### Policy Deployment

Automated policy deployment pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/policy-deployment.yml
name: Policy Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['policies/**']

jobs:
  deploy-policies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Deploy organizational policies
        run: |
          flowlyt deploy-policy \
            --policy policies/organizational/ \
            --scope organization \
            --gradual-rollout \
            --notification-channel slack://security-team
            
      - name: Update policy documentation
        run: |
          flowlyt generate-policy-docs \
            --policies policies/ \
            --output docs/policies/ \
            --format markdown
            
      - name: Notify stakeholders
        run: |
          flowlyt notify-policy-update \
            --changes ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }} \
            --stakeholders security-team@company.com,compliance@company.com
```

## Policy Monitoring and Reporting
