# Example GitHub Actions Workflows for Flowlyt Integration

This directory contains example workflows demonstrating how to integrate Flowlyt security scanning into your CI/CD pipeline with proper error handling and policy enforcement.

## Basic Integration

### Simple Security Scan

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run Flowlyt Security Scan
      uses: harekrishnarai/flowlyt@v1
      with:
        fail-on-severity: 'HIGH'
        upload-sarif: true
```

### Enterprise Integration with Policy Enforcement

```yaml
name: Enterprise Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run Enterprise Security Scan
      id: flowlyt
      uses: harekrishnarai/flowlyt@v1
      with:
        config-file: '.flowlyt-enterprise.yml'
        output-format: 'sarif'
        fail-on-severity: 'CRITICAL'
        max-critical: 0
        max-high: 5
        enable-policy-enforcement: true
        enable-vuln-intel: true
        compliance-frameworks: 'pci-dss,sox'
        upload-sarif: true
        comment-on-pr: true
        create-issue: true
        issue-labels: 'security,critical,flowlyt'
    
    - name: Security Gate Check
      if: steps.flowlyt.outputs.critical-count > 0
      run: |
        echo "üö® SECURITY GATE FAILED"
        echo "Critical vulnerabilities found: ${{ steps.flowlyt.outputs.critical-count }}"
        echo "Blocking policy violations: ${{ steps.flowlyt.outputs.blocking-violations }}"
        echo "This deployment is blocked until security issues are resolved."
        exit 1
```

## Advanced Pipeline Integration

          ### Action Required
          One or more compliance frameworks are showing violations that must be addressed:
          
          1. Review the workflow run for detailed findings
          2. Address compliance violations according to your organization's policies
          3. Re-run compliance validation to verify fixes
          
          **Priority:** High - Compliance violations may impact audit readiness

These workflow examples demonstrate:

1. **Progressive Security Gates** - Block deployments based on severity
2. **Enterprise Policy Enforcement** - Use advanced configuration features
3. **Compliance Integration** - Multiple framework validation
4. **Automated Issue Creation** - Create GitHub issues for critical findings
5. **SARIF Upload** - Integration with GitHub Security tab
6. **PR Comments** - Automated security feedback
7. **Multi-Environment Pipelines** - Different security requirements per environment
8. **Monitoring & Trending** - Continuous security posture tracking

The workflows properly handle critical issues and can break pipelines when security thresholds are exceeded, providing enterprise-grade security gate functionality.
