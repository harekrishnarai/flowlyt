# Changelog - Version 1.0.5

**Release Date:** December 27, 2025

## 🎉 What's New

Version 1.0.5 introduces intelligent terminal output with xterm detection, enhanced CLI formatting, and improved report generation.

## ✨ Features

### Intelligent Terminal Output Package
- **Terminal Detection**: Auto-detect TTY, terminal width, height, and color capabilities
- **Color Level Support**: None/Basic/256/TrueColor with automatic RGB-to-ANSI conversion
- **Progress Indicators**: 
  - ProgressBar with ETA calculation and customizable styles
  - Spinner with multiple animation styles (dots, line, arrows, etc.)
  - MultiSpinner for tracking concurrent operations
- **Advanced Formatting**:
  - Tables with responsive width and multiple styles
  - Lists with bullet points and numbering
  - Banners, sections, and dividers
  - Box drawing with Unicode characters
- **Hyperlink Support**: OSC 8 escape sequences for clickable terminal links with graceful fallback
- **Enhanced CLI Output**: 
  - Modern code snippet formatting with syntax highlighting
  - Data flow visualization for sensitive data tracking
  - Improved finding display with severity badges and context

### Report Generation Improvements
- **Clean File Paths**: Remove temporary directory prefixes from all output formats (CLI, JSON, Markdown, SARIF)
- **Verbose Flag Plumbing**: Properly pass verbose flag to all report generators
- **Remote Repository Display**: Show repository URL instead of temp paths in scan information
- **Markdown Label Cleaning**: Display repo-relative paths in link labels while preserving clickable URLs
- **GitHub/GitLab Links**: Maintain direct file links with cleaned display text

### CI/CD Integration
- **Optimized Docker Workflow**: Only trigger on tag releases and published releases (no longer on every push)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed scope errors in report generation (undefined `repoURL` and `c` identifiers)
- Resolved terminal spinner conflicts (SpinnerLine type vs variable naming)
- Fixed code snippet alignment ("Potential Issue Here" arrow now properly positioned)
- Corrected verbose evidence display in CLI and report outputs

## 📦 Dependencies

- Added `golang.org/x/term` for terminal capabilities detection
- Updated `go.mod` and `go.sum` with terminal package dependencies

## 🔧 Technical Changes

- New package: `pkg/terminal` with comprehensive terminal handling
- Enhanced `pkg/report/enhanced_formatter.go` with `cleanFilePath()` helper
- Updated `pkg/report/report.go` to sanitize file paths in JSON output
- Modified `cmd/flowlyt/main.go` to properly propagate verbose and repository URL

## 📝 Documentation

- Updated README.md with v1.0.5 installation instructions
- Updated README-ACTION.md with v1.0.5 usage examples
- Added COMMANDS.md updates reflecting new terminal features
